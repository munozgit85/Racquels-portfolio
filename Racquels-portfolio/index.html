          The idea of coding came about only recently in my life at the age of 36. Prior to this I was focusing on my career in healthcare. I discovered documentation was cumbersome, and unnecessarily timely. This led to my 
          search for ways to enhance healthcare documentation, to make it user friendly, HIPPA compliant, and voice activated.These are ways to reduce the users time in documentation. 
          For this reason, I diverted to coding to make this possible. Understanding software development is the key to enhancing the electronic medical recording systems. 
          Currently, I am a student in a coding bootcamp, and below are some of the projects that I have been working on.
