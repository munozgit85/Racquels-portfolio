          <p>
            The idea of coding came about only recently in my life at the age of 36. Prior to this I was focusing on my career in healthcare. I discovered documentation was cumbersome, and unnecessarily timely. This led to my 
            search for ways to enhance healthcare documentation, to make it user friendly, HIPPA compliant, and voice activated.These are ways to reduce the users time in documentation. 
            For this reason, I diverted my attention to software development for the electronic medical record. Understanding the different coding languages to develop software is essential. Currently, I am a student in a coding bootcamp, and below are some of my current, and future projects.
